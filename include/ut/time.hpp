            %a     The abbreviated name of the day of the week according to
                   the current locale.  (Calculated from tm_wday.)  (The
                   specific names used in the current locale can be obtained
                   by calling nl_langinfo(3) with ABDAY_{1–7} as an
                   argument.)

            %A     The full name of the day of the week according to the
                   current locale.  (Calculated from tm_wday.)  (The specific
                   names used in the current locale can be obtained by
                   calling nl_langinfo(3) with DAY_{1–7} as an argument.)

            %b     The abbreviated month name according to the current
                   locale.  (Calculated from tm_mon.)  (The specific names
                   used in the current locale can be obtained by calling
                   nl_langinfo(3) with ABMON_{1–12} as an argument.)

            %B     The full month name according to the current locale.
                   (Calculated from tm_mon.)  (The specific names used in the
                   current locale can be obtained by calling nl_langinfo(3)
                   with MON_{1–12} as an argument.)

            %c     The preferred date and time representation for the current
                   locale.  (The specific format used in the current locale
                   can be obtained by calling nl_langinfo(3) with D_T_FMT as
                   an argument for the %c conversion specification, and with
                   ERA_D_T_FMT for the %Ec conversion specification.)  (In
                   the POSIX locale this is equivalent to %a %b %e %H:%M:%S
                   %Y.)

            %C     The century number (year/100) as a 2-digit integer. (SU)
                   (The %EC conversion specification corresponds to the name
                   of the era.)  (Calculated from tm_year.)

            %d     The day of the month as a decimal number (range 01 to 31).
                   (Calculated from tm_mday.)

            %D     Equivalent to %m/%d/%y.  (Yecch—for Americans only.
                   Americans should note that in other countries %d/%m/%y is
                   rather common.  This means that in international context
                   this format is ambiguous and should not be used.) (SU)

            %e     Like %d, the day of the month as a decimal number, but a
                   leading zero is replaced by a space. (SU) (Calculated from
                   tm_mday.)

            %E     Modifier: use alternative ("era-based") format, see below.
                   (SU)

            %F     Equivalent to %Y-%m-%d (the ISO 8601 date format). (C99)

            %G     The ISO 8601 week-based year (see NOTES) with century as a
                   decimal number.  The 4-digit year corresponding to the ISO
                   week number (see %V).  This has the same format and value
                   as %Y, except that if the ISO week number belongs to the
                   previous or next year, that year is used instead. (TZ)
                   (Calculated from tm_year, tm_yday, and tm_wday.)

            %g     Like %G, but without century, that is, with a 2-digit year
                   (00–99). (TZ) (Calculated from tm_year, tm_yday, and
                   tm_wday.)

            %h     Equivalent to %b.  (SU)

            %H     The hour as a decimal number using a 24-hour clock (range
                   00 to 23).  (Calculated from tm_hour.)

            %I     The hour as a decimal number using a 12-hour clock (range
                   01 to 12).  (Calculated from tm_hour.)

            %j     The day of the year as a decimal number (range 001 to
                   366).  (Calculated from tm_yday.)

            %k     The hour (24-hour clock) as a decimal number (range 0 to
                   23); single digits are preceded by a blank.  (See also
                   %H.)  (Calculated from tm_hour.)  (TZ)

            %l     The hour (12-hour clock) as a decimal number (range 1 to
                   12); single digits are preceded by a blank.  (See also
                   %I.)  (Calculated from tm_hour.)  (TZ)

            %m     The month as a decimal number (range 01 to 12).
                   (Calculated from tm_mon.)

            %M     The minute as a decimal number (range 00 to 59).
                   (Calculated from tm_min.)

            %n     A newline character. (SU)

            %O     Modifier: use alternative numeric symbols, see below. (SU)

            %p     Either "AM" or "PM" according to the given time value, or
                   the corresponding strings for the current locale.  Noon is
                   treated as "PM" and midnight as "AM".  (Calculated from
                   tm_hour.)  (The specific string representations used for
                   "AM" and "PM" in the current locale can be obtained by
                   calling nl_langinfo(3) with AM_STR and PM_STR,
                   respectively.)

            %P     Like %p but in lowercase: "am" or "pm" or a corresponding
                   string for the current locale.  (Calculated from tm_hour.)
                   (GNU)

            %r     The time in a.m. or p.m. notation.  (SU) (The specific
                   format used in the current locale can be obtained by
                   calling nl_langinfo(3) with T_FMT_AMPM as an argument.)
                   (In the POSIX locale this is equivalent to %I:%M:%S %p.)

            %R     The time in 24-hour notation (%H:%M).  (SU) For a version
                   including the seconds, see %T below.

            %s     The number of seconds since the Epoch, 1970-01-01 00:00:00
                   +0000 (UTC). (TZ) (Calculated from mktime(tm).)

            %S     The second as a decimal number (range 00 to 60).  (The
                   range is up to 60 to allow for occasional leap seconds.)
                   (Calculated from tm_sec.)

            %t     A tab character. (SU)

            %T     The time in 24-hour notation (%H:%M:%S).  (SU)

            %u     The day of the week as a decimal, range 1 to 7, Monday
                   being 1.  See also %w.  (Calculated from tm_wday.)  (SU)

            %U     The week number of the current year as a decimal number,
                   range 00 to 53, starting with the first Sunday as the
                   first day of week 01.  See also %V and %W.  (Calculated
                   from tm_yday and tm_wday.)

            %V     The ISO 8601 week number (see NOTES) of the current year
                   as a decimal number, range 01 to 53, where week 1 is the
                   first week that has at least 4 days in the new year.  See
                   also %U and %W.  (Calculated from tm_year, tm_yday, and
                   tm_wday.)  (SU)

            %w     The day of the week as a decimal, range 0 to 6, Sunday
                   being 0.  See also %u.  (Calculated from tm_wday.)

            %W     The week number of the current year as a decimal number,
                   range 00 to 53, starting with the first Monday as the
                   first day of week 01.  (Calculated from tm_yday and
                   tm_wday.)

            %x     The preferred date representation for the current locale
                   without the time.  (The specific format used in the
                   current locale can be obtained by calling nl_langinfo(3)
                   with D_FMT as an argument for the %x conversion
                   specification, and with ERA_D_FMT for the %Ex conversion
                   specification.)  (In the POSIX locale this is equivalent
                   to %m/%d/%y.)

            %X     The preferred time representation for the current locale
                   without the date.  (The specific format used in the
                   current locale can be obtained by calling nl_langinfo(3)
                   with T_FMT as an argument for the %X conversion
                   specification, and with ERA_T_FMT for the %EX conversion
                   specification.)  (In the POSIX locale this is equivalent
                   to %H:%M:%S.)

            %y     The year as a decimal number without a century (range 00
                   to 99).  (The %Ey conversion specification corresponds to
                   the year since the beginning of the era denoted by the %EC
                   conversion specification.)  (Calculated from tm_year)

            %Y     The year as a decimal number including the century.  (The
                   %EY conversion specification corresponds to the full
                   alternative year representation.)  (Calculated from
                   tm_year)

            %z     The +hhmm or -hhmm numeric timezone (that is, the hour and
                   minute offset from UTC). (SU)

            %Z     The timezone name or abbreviation.
