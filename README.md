A collection of common code I use in my personal projects. 

I've maintained this in some form since I was in high school. 

It is my üç≤ [Perpetual Stew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpetual_stew) of code, and it's very tasty!

## Highlights 

- **A complete string view implementation.**
- **Basic terminal utilities: escape sequences, raw mode, shell, etc...**
- **Various math utilities, for gamedev and graphics code.**
- **Many more misc. utilities...**
